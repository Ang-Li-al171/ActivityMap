ActivityMap
Authors:
    The first iteration of these visualizations was created by Hal Beresford.
    Steve Chall added some additional functionality.
    Ang Li is currently doing the lion's share of development work.

To run the "shiny" application:

-Download and install R software

-Then download the shiny package by typing in R console 

	install.packages("shiny")

-Type in R console

	library("shiny")	

-Type (Note: slashes in the path are leftward slash --- / )

 	runApp("~/FullPathOfFolder/")	where the folder contains the ui.R and server.R files

UPDATE(07/18/2013)

!! Please copy all the files in the folder, because a few new files have been added for object decoding

- object interactions tab now gives the option to plot with subjects/object type with a radio button
- choice of subjects still available when plotting using object type, giving more freedom/choice
- frequency count statistics about object type for each subject chosen
- detailed information about each object interacted by each subject. It may be a very long list, so don't choose "all subjects" with a long period of time, when you want to see the details
- a color/shape legend for object type plot
- other minor changes


UPDATE(07/17/2013)

!! Need to install.packages("pixmap") in order to have conversation heap map working
!! Please copy all the files in the folder, because a few new files have been added, including a headphone picture and conversation data

- Conversation heap map is working now, with the number of conversations indicated on the building for a specified time-period
- A drop-down list allows user to choose potential conversations within that period, and it'd identify possible subjects involved.
- This feature works well when you choose a short time-period, such as one or two days
- The Conversation map allows position data, easy to verify possible subjects involved
- Other minor changes, titles, etc.


UPDATE (07/11/2013)

!! Need to install.packages("chron") in order to have time selection feature

-able to select time periods, up to seconds, in a day
-Used Final Survey Data instead of previous survey data. Updated option list for survey plot.
-New tab for Object Interaction Heat Map, with color legend, and option to list all items as before.
-New tab for Conversations Heat Map, still in progress.
-Moved raw data to the fourth tab.
-Other minors improvements on titles, cosmetics, etc.


UPDATE(07/09/2013)

-Removed "Update Plots" button to enable complete interactivity -- automatic update
-Checking/unchecking "All subjects" now checks/unchecks all the 20 boxes for the user
-Made the sidebar narrower and the activity map larger (still square) for better view
-Unused options will not be visible when viewing the "Object & Raw Data" panel
-Formal DateInput for View By Real Date feature
-Other minor cosmetic improvements, titles, etc.

-Added Macro Control in ui.R and server.R to switch between full and anonymous versions.
-Radio Button choice for view by DayCount or Real Date
-Slight increase in y-spacing of color legends
-Code cleaned up according to Google's R Style Guide

UPDATE(07/02/2013)

-Able to view the map by Real Date from 2011/01 to 2012/12

-Object interaction information is presented as an "object - interaction count" format, to capture how many times an object is interacted with by the subject.

UPDATE(06/25/2013):

-Currently working on putting the app on a web server.

-Added survey data plots. All survey question score plots are available in a drop-down list.
